This folder contains standalone IRunnable implementations that are intended 
to exercise the source generator while still allowing easy modifications using 
the full editor capabilities (instead of editing a string inside a unit test).

They are not annotated as `[Fact]` since they are instead run from a single 
theory-driven test.
